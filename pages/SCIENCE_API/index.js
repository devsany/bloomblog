    blog_title: "Can AI solve the clinical data problem?",
    blog_description:
      "There is a lot of confusion and excitement surrounding the questions of whether and how artificial intelligence (AI) will transform mental health care. As a pain physician and psychiatrist, I (D.B.) am unsettled by the abstraction “AI,” especially when I think of individual patients and the concrete reasons they seek treatment.The amorphous concept of “AI” is better suited for hype than for practical solutions to the problems that patients bring to my office. As a field, AI is rapidly advancing and is beginning to solve previously impossible problems. But whether “AI” will benefit mental health care is akin to asking whether a “drug” will benefit mental health care. A drug is simply a molecule. Whether a specific molecule will resolve a specific problem for a specific patient at a specific time is a clear, testable hypothesis—a hypothesis that clinicians form and test each time we prescribe a molecule to our patients. Likewise, an AI is simply an algorithm. And the hypothesis that any particular AI algorithm will be effective in any specific situation is, of course, testable.The problem that AI engineers (such as X.L. and Q.L.) face is not a specific algorithm’s capability (which can be immense) but our inability to clearly identify the clinical problem that the algorithm needs to, and can, solve. To truly flex AI in mental health care, problems should be identified and grounded in specific patient needs.Imagine that you’re suffering from insomnia. To solve this problem, you turn to the internet. You describe your symptoms in a few words, hit return, and get ~2,930,000,000 results in 0.37 seconds. You find some suggestions for sleep hygiene and mindfulness and decide to sign up for a meditation app. In other words, you identified and described your symptoms to a search engine, found candidate solutions, and tested those solutions.If sleep hygiene and meditation don’t help, you schedule an appointment with your clinician. But what is it you hope your clinician will do for you? You already have all the available data about your specific sleep and mood as well as access to a wealth of medical information. Yet a search engine alone hasn’t solved your problem, which is your inability to interpret and act on the data you have.AI engineers should consider that a clinician solves a patient’s problem by gathering information and then helping them interpret and act on their data. The clinical exam is simply a structured data-gathering procedure—nothing magical occurs, just an old-fashioned data exchange, in the form of talking.Framed as a data problem, it’s obvious where and why AI can benefit mental health care. Before, during, and between clinical encounters, AI algorithms can help gather, interpret, and act on clinical data (see the table). With the exciting new developments of foundation models and intelligent agents, an “AI” system could even tailor the “action” based on a specific patient, clinician, or hospital system.The problems and risks that an AI tool must manage depend on which stage of data problem it’s meant to solve. Any tool—AI or otherwise—that might help mental health professionals more efficiently gather your history, interpret that history in the context of the ever-growing scientific research, and act on your particular problems would be a boon to mental health care. But to enter clinical practice, AI tools must be vetted, tested, and financially justified, a process that will require us to bring greater specificity to the way physicians gather, interpret, and act to benefit a patient’s data problem.",

      "The app splits the display into two images and the viewer’s lenses project opposing viewpoints with the result that your brain perceives depth. To select from a menu or progress to a new sequence in the app, you press a button on top of the viewer. This simulates a finger tap as a fabric swatch is forced across the smartphone screen.This has inspired more than a few luminaries claiming the future of VR is most certainly mobile. If the computer in our pockets can be used to deliver immersive experiences, then mass market penetration begins to seem more likely. Google’s interest in VR makes perfect sense in terms of the potential for Youtube premium content and the advertising revenue that will follow. Indeed a recent MIT article suggested that Google cardboard may well kill off the high end manufacturers before they get going.But why does any of this matter? It matters because for years the advertising and entertainment industries have worked hard to deliver experiences that engage consumers, hoping to make a connection with our emotional brains. And this is perhaps VR’s most significant innovation. Virtual reality removes the final thin layer between content and audience, between product and user – presenting an alternate simulated world into which we can be transported.One of VR’s early pioneers Chris Milk goes further to say that it is “… more than a medium (but) fundamentally an alternative level of human consciousness”. What he’s talking about here is known in the VR community as ‘presence’: the instance when your brain is tricked into thinking that that what you see is real – sort of.",
