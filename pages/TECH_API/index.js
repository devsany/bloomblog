      "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Meta (Facebook) CEO Mark Zuckerberg headlined at Siggraph last week. While the fireside chat with Huang didn’t really cover any new territory, the subsequent chat between Zuckerberg and Huang was fascinating, particularly when it came to what they didn’t talk about, which was the future of Facebook with AI. But, based on what they did say, I think I can fill that gap. The two men differed on the future of personal technology, mainly because Zuckerberg talked about what could be done, while Huang focused on what should be done. That dynamic is worth exploring, so we’ll do that this week. We’ll close with my Product of the Week, a godsend at this time of year if you want to sleep cool but don’t want to spend a fortune running the air conditioner all night. Zuckerberg Remake The session between Zuckerberg and Huang was fascinating to watch for several reasons, not the least of which was that Zuckerberg presented as a real person instead of the android-like character he typically reflects. He was personable, seemed to truly like Huang, and came across not only as smart, which he has done, but personable, which is new. It reminded me of “Star Trek: The Next Generation” when Lore showed up as Data’s more emotional twin brother. Zuckerberg’s people skills have improved dramatically since last I saw him, which undoubtedly took a ton of work that paid off. I think he will be far better received now. If you watch the video and put aside your prior impressions of the guy, Zuckerberg presents himself as bright but normal, which is a huge improvement. The Future of Personal Technology Huang and Zuckerberg spoke about many things, but when they started discussing advanced AR/VR headsets, it felt like they had drifted into what would come after smartphones. You see, smartphones are still primarily based on the GUI interface that we initially got with PCs. In many ways, they are just small PCs with touchscreens instead of keyboards and mice. However, AI, particularly conversational AI, can use natural language as the interface. Talking to your smartphone might be an initial implementation, but wouldn’t it be better if you wore the thing that would put the microphone closer to your face and, with a glasses form factor, the display in front of your eyes?People walk around today with their faces buried in their phones, which is incredibly unsafe. But if you were able to put the display translucently in front of their eyes and coupled that with a camera, similar to what self-driving cars have, then the glasses could warn you to avoid obstacles (and vehicles), and your hands would be free to carry stuff or help with balance.Zuckerberg was still thinking about his Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses, which will take commands, convey sounds, and capture images. However, they lack a built-in display because it would double the cost and make the glasses heavy and bulky. He was right that people have resisted wearing a heavy headset like Apple’s Vision Pro, which comes closest in terms of capabilities to what Huang was talking about as the future.",

      "The app splits the display into two images and the viewer’s lenses project opposing viewpoints with the result that your brain perceives depth. To select from a menu or progress to a new sequence in the app, you press a button on top of the viewer. This simulates a finger tap as a fabric swatch is forced across the smartphone screen.This has inspired more than a few luminaries claiming the future of VR is most certainly mobile. If the computer in our pockets can be used to deliver immersive experiences, then mass market penetration begins to seem more likely. Google’s interest in VR makes perfect sense in terms of the potential for Youtube premium content and the advertising revenue that will follow. Indeed a recent MIT article suggested that Google cardboard may well kill off the high end manufacturers before they get going.But why does any of this matter? It matters because for years the advertising and entertainment industries have worked hard to deliver experiences that engage consumers, hoping to make a connection with our emotional brains. And this is perhaps VR’s most significant innovation. Virtual reality removes the final thin layer between content and audience, between product and user – presenting an alternate simulated world into which we can be transported.One of VR’s early pioneers Chris Milk goes further to say that it is “… more than a medium (but) fundamentally an alternative level of human consciousness”. What he’s talking about here is known in the VR community as ‘presence’: the instance when your brain is tricked into thinking that that what you see is real – sort of.",
