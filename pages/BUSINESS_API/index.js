      "In August 2018, Google’s algorithm updates took a turn that the SEO community couldn’t ignore.Often referred to as the “Medic” update, this series of algorithm changes began noticeably rewarding sites that excelled in E-A-T (Expertise, Authoritativeness, and Trust).Then came December 2022, and Google threw another “E” into the mix — Experience. Now, E-E-A-T is the gold standard for high-quality, user-centric content on the web.We are a 90-person SEO agency of that has helped companies with some of the best E-E-A-T in the world, like Casper and Intuit, reach new heights. In just six months, we increased Casper’s organic traffic by 280%. Through partnerships like this, we’ve developed a sharp eye for what it means to have good E-E-A-T.E-E-A-T stands for Experience, Expertise, Authority, and Trustworthiness. Google uses these characteristics to determine the authenticity and quality of a web page to minimize misinformation and increase the amount of useful content on the internet.While E-E-A-T isn’t a ranking factor — it isn’t a quantifiable criterion Google uses to determine whether a page should rank — it still matters to Google. A lot.E-E-A-T comes from Google’s Search Quality Rater Guidelines — a 176-page document used by manual reviewers (that’s right — real humans) to assess the quality of Google’s search results.Google originally published this document online in 2013 to help content creators understand what Google looks for in a web page. However, it wasn’t until 2018 that Google started explicitly rewarding great E-E-A-T.The December 2022 update (which officially added “Experience” to the mix) was essentially Google’s effort to reemphasize the value of content written by authors who really know what they’re talking about and have something valuable to offer.E-E-A-T is not easy to establish, but putting time and effort into doing it well is worth it in both the short and long run.",

      "Even further, think about Google itself. There’s no authority in the search engine space higher than Google. After all, it literally makes the rules.While you shouldn’t expect yourself to become the Google of your industry, there’s a lot you can learn from industry leaders about what it looks like to be an authority.Examples of authoritativeness:User reviews, expert recommendations and other credible insights written by individuals that provide information about the website Signals of reputation, such as awards and accolades or involvement in current controversies/eventsTrustworthiness is all about consistency. Do you impress your customers and site visitors every time, or has your trustworthiness slipped through the cracks?Unfortunately, second chances for brands are rare. Delivering false information or inconsistently living out your brand’s mission could result in a tarnished reputation and reduced trust in the eyes of your customers and Google.A great way to develop trustworthiness is to be transparent from the start.Take Bankrate, for example. It provides readers with a disclaimer that calls attention to its editorial standards as well as how it makes money.",
