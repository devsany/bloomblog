      "An art project begins with a creative spark and lets kids bring their imagination to life, but it also strengthens their logical thinking skills too! You’ve probably heard about the somewhat-debunked right brain, left brain theory. The idea was that creative people were right-brained because the right brain is more visual and artistic, while the left brain is verbal, analytical, and detail-oriented. The truth is that both sides work together, and art is an excellent tool for helping kids take a creative concept from start to finish, work through artistic challenges and mistakes, and have fun while learning.

    blog_description:
      "Children thrive when they can practice decision-making and express themselves without worrying about a right or wrong answer. They can learn how to trust themselves and communicate their thoughts and feelings with art. Unlike schoolwork, there’s no good or bad, to worry about — it’s all about their vision and goals. There may be a few rules like, Paint only on the canvas, but otherwise the final product is completely in their hands. The more they can freely practice self-expression, the more confident they’ll feel. It’s also a great language development opportunity because they can pick up new art terms along the way. ",

      "The app splits the display into two images and the viewer’s lenses project opposing viewpoints with the result that your brain perceives depth. To select from a menu or progress to a new sequence in the app, you press a button on top of the viewer. This simulates a finger tap as a fabric swatch is forced across the smartphone screen.This has inspired more than a few luminaries claiming the future of VR is most certainly mobile. If the computer in our pockets can be used to deliver immersive experiences, then mass market penetration begins to seem more likely. Google’s interest in VR makes perfect sense in terms of the potential for Youtube premium content and the advertising revenue that will follow. Indeed a recent MIT article suggested that Google cardboard may well kill off the high end manufacturers before they get going.But why does any of this matter? It matters because for years the advertising and entertainment industries have worked hard to deliver experiences that engage consumers, hoping to make a connection with our emotional brains. And this is perhaps VR’s most significant innovation. Virtual reality removes the final thin layer between content and audience, between product and user – presenting an alternate simulated world into which we can be transported.One of VR’s early pioneers Chris Milk goes further to say that it is … more than a medium (but) fundamentally an alternative level of human consciousness. What he’s talking about here is known in the VR community as ‘presence’: the instance when your brain is tricked into thinking that that what you see is real – sort of.",
